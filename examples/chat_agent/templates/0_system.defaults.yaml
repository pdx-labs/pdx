compound: Glucose
content: "Glucose is a sugar with the molecular formula C6H12O6. Glucose is overall the most 
abundant monosaccharide,[3] a subcategory of carbohydrates. Glucose is mainly made by plants 
and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight, 
where it is used to make cellulose in cell walls, the most abundant carbohydrate in the world.[4]

In energy metabolism, glucose is the most important source of energy in all organisms. Glucose 
for metabolism is stored as a polymer, in plants mainly as starch and amylopectin, and in animals 
as glycogen. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar. The naturally occurring 
form of glucose is d-glucose, while its stereoisomer l-glucose is produced synthetically in 
comparatively small amounts and is less biologically active.[5] Glucose is a monosaccharide 
containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose 
molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form. Glucose is naturally 
occurring and is found in its free state in fruits and other parts of plants. In animals, glucose 
is released from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis.

Glucose, as intravenous sugar solution, is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential 
Medicines.[6] It is also on the list in combination with sodium chloride.[6]"
